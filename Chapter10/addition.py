# Exercise 10-6 and 10-7. From the book Python Crash Course 2nd Edition 
# by Erick Matthews
# 
# Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs
# when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the
# input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for
# two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if
# either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message.
# Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text
# instead of a number.

# Addition Calculator: Wrap your code from Exercise 10-6 in a while loop
# so the user can continue entering numbers even if they make a mistake and
# enter text instead of a number.
