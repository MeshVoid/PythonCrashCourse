# Verify User: The final listing for remember_me.py assumes either that the
# user has already entered their username or that the program is running for
# the first time. We should modify it in case the current user is not the
# person who last used the program. 
# 
# Before printing a welcome back message in greet_user(), ask the user if this
# is the correct username. If itâ€™s not, call get_new_username() to get the
# correct username
