# Exercise 11-3 From the book Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Erick Matthews

# Employee: Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take 
# in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these
# as attributes. Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5,000 to 
# the annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.

# Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_default
# _raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t
# have to create a new employee instance in each test method. 
# Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass
