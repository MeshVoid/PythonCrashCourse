# Exercise 9-4. From the book Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Erick Matthews

# Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162). Add an
# attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an instance
# called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the 
# restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.

# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of 
# customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print
# the value again. Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you
# increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with 
# any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, 
# say, a day of business.
