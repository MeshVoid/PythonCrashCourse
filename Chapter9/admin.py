# Exercise 9-7. From the book Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Erick Matthews
#
# Admin: An administrator is a special kind of user. 
# Write a class called Admin that inherits from the User class you wrote in
# 
# Exercise 9-3 (page 162) or Exercise 9-5 (page 167). 
# Add an attribute, privileges, that stores a list of strings like 
# "can add post", "can delete post", "can ban user", and so on. 
# Write a method called show_privileges() that lists the administratorâ€™s 
# set of privileges. Create an instance of Admin, and call your method.
