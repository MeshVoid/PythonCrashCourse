# PythonCrashCourse

Completion of every goddamn exercise from every single chapter and a example programs from the book
**Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes**

Every chapter has notes.md in it containing all the notes I took from each chapter of the book.
Should be a great help when I would like to refresh my memories on Python fundamentals, I guess.
