# Exercise 5-7. From the book Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Erick Matthews

# Favorite Fruit: Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of 
# independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
# 
# • Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
# • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. 

# If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

favourite_fruits = ['bananas', 'oranges', 'lemons', 'apples', 'tangerines']

if 'bananas' in favourite_fruits:
    print("You really like bananas!")
if 'oranges' in favourite_fruits:
    print('You really like oranges!')
if 'lemons' is favourite_fruits:
    print('You really like lemons!')
if 'apples' in favourite_fruits:
    print('You really like apples!')
if 'apricots' in favourite_fruits:
    print('You really like apricots!')
if 'mangoes' in favourite_fruits:
    print('You really like mangoes')
