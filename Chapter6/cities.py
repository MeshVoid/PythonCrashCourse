# Exercise 6-11. From the book Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Erick Matthews.

# Cities: Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys
# in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and
# include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one
# fact about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something
# like country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the
# information you have stored about it.
