# Exercise 8-7. From the book Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Erick Matthews

# User Albums: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
# album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces
# of information.

# Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.
# Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the album
# information correctly.
#
# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album()
# that allows you to store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line
# includes a value for the number of songs, add that value to the albumâ€™s
# dictionary. Make at least one new function call that includes the number
# of songs on an album
